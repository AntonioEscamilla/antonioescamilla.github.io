The **Python for Data Science** course introduces students to the world's leading programming language for data analysis within the context of the [Information and Communication Technologies](https://www.upb.edu.co/es/postgrados/maestria-tecnologias-informacion-comunicacion-medellin) M.Sc. program at UPB. This postgraduate-level course equips students with the programming skills needed to transform raw data into actionable insights, discover hidden patterns, and communicate findings effectively through impactful visualizations.

Python has become the dominant programming language in data science due to its unique combination of simplicity, readability, and power, making it the preferred tool for analysts, data scientists, and researchers worldwide. Throughout this course, students will build from language fundamentals to advanced data manipulation and analysis techniques, learning to address complex problems, make evidence-based decisions, and generate value across virtually any industry or research field.

The course covers essential Python concepts including data types, control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming principles. Students will master Python's core data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples) and learn to work with popular data science libraries and packages. Emphasis is placed on practical application through hands-on exercises, real-world datasets, and interactive examples that build confidence in data analysis workflows.

The course is designed for students with varied backgrounds, including those with limited programming experience. Through progressive learning modules covering everything from basic syntax to advanced data processing techniques, students will develop a solid foundation in Python programming. Key topics include variable manipulation, control flow, function creation, data structure operations, text processing, and package management - all essential skills for modern data science applications.

By the end of the course, students will be prepared to leverage Python's powerful ecosystem for data science, equipped with the skills to handle complex analytical challenges and implement intelligent data processing systems across diverse domains including research, business analytics, and technical innovation.
