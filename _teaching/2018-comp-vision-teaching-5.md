The Computer Vision course will introduce students to the fascinating world of image analysis and object recognition within the context of the Digital Arts M.A. program at ITM. This graduate course equips students with the skills to utilize computer vision techniques for creating interactive and visually compelling digital art. Students will learn to detect, monitor, and recognize objects in digital images, using these capabilities to enhance human-computer interaction and develop innovative art projects.

Throughout the course, students will explore various computer vision methodologies and their practical applications in the digital arts. They will gain hands-on experience with state-of-the-art tools and technologies, enabling them to incorporate image analysis techniques into their creative processes. By the end of the course, students will be proficient in using computer vision as a control system for digital art, fostering a new level of interaction between the artist and their audience.

The course is designed for students from diverse backgrounds, including those with no prior experience in computer vision or programming. Through practical examples and projects, students will be able to immediately apply their knowledge to create unique and engaging works of digital art. This course aims to blend technical skills with artistic creativity, providing a comprehensive understanding of computer vision within the realm of digital arts.
