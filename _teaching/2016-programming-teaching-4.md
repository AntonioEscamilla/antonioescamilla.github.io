The **Creative Programming** course will provide an introduction to programming and code in the context of the **Digital Arts** M.A. program at ITM. On this graduate course students learn to use computer code to create unique pieces of computational art, using the accessible and widely used **OpenFrameworks** programming language. Students will develop an understanding of this new and exciting creative medium, and gain the practical skills to begin experimenting and creating works of their own. No programming experience is needed to attend this course, and even if students are tech novices, they will be able to produce pieces of work by the end of the course. The course has been specifically designed to learn to code in the context of visual arts and design, and students will learn through practical examples that they can immediately apply.
