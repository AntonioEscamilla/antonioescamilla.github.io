## Description of the course
The course contributes to the student's professional training by developing skills to create intelligent programs that imitate characteristics associated with human intelligence or other living beings. The course has a practical approach to problem-solving using the Python programming language. The main contents of the course are Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision.

## Purpose of the course
Develop solutions to data analysis problems using computing tools to incorporate them into data processing systems through the application of Artificial Intelligence techniques. In the course, a final project is developed that includes the design, implementation, and evaluation of an intelligent system, allowing the development of data analysis competence with artificial intelligence methods at an autonomous level.

## Learning Outcomes
* Statistical and Analytical Competence: Apply statistical methodologies, techniques, and tools to support and enhance decision-making processes in various contexts.
* Computational Problem-Solving: Develop and implement effective solutions for data analysis problems using advanced computing tools, integrating these solutions into comprehensive data processing systems.
