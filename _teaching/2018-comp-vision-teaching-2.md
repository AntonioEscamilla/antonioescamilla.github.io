## Course Description
This undergraduate Computer Vision course at Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, School of Engineering, offers students a comprehensive understanding of techniques used for detecting, monitoring, and recognizing objects in digital images. The course emphasizes practical applications, allowing students to leverage image variations as control systems for enhancing human-computer interaction.

## Purpose of the Course
The purpose of this course is to familiarize students with essential techniques for detecting, monitoring, and recognizing objects within digital images. Students will learn to use these techniques to develop control systems that facilitate interaction between humans and computers.

## Learning Outcomes
* Problem-Solving in Engineering: Identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems by applying mathematical principles and understanding the problem-solving process within the context of computer vision.
* Project-Based Application: Analyze, design, implement, operate, and evaluate solutions for digital entertainment projects, ensuring they meet specific project requirements through computer vision techniques.

## Project-based Methodology
This project-based course is structured around developing computer vision applications that integrate various advanced concepts and techniques in the field. Students will work on projects ranging from basic image manipulation to the implementation of hand and body detection models, applying knowledge in image and video processing.

Project-based work will allow students to delve deeper into topics such as basic image manipulation and operations, color segmentation, video processing and analysis, filtering techniques, and transformations. In addition, practical applications such as the use of ArUco markers for augmented reality, the implementation of hand and body detection models, and pose classification systems will be explored.

This course is developed around a Notion page as its central axis. Access is open to anyone interested in the topic or the methodology. [Notion site](https://foil-bamboo-097.notion.site/Visi-n-Artificial-83054a02d41e486a9c758431115bde89).
