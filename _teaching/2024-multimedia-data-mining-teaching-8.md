The **Multimedia Data Mining** course introduces students to the dynamic field of data analysis applied to multimedia content within the context of the [Information and Communication Technologies](https://www.upb.edu.co/es/postgrados/maestria-tecnologias-informacion-comunicacion-medellin) M.Sc. program at UPB. This graduate-level course equips students with the analytical and computational skills needed to extract meaningful insights from diverse data sources such as images, audio, video, and text. Students will learn to identify patterns, trends, and correlations in multimedia datasets, applying this knowledge to solve complex problems in creative and technical domains.

Throughout the course, students will explore key methodologies in data mining and machine learning, with a special focus on how these techniques apply to unstructured multimedia content. Emphasis will be placed on feature extraction, classification, clustering, and multimedia information retrieval. Hands-on experience with modern tools and real-world datasets will enable students to design and implement intelligent systems capable of understanding and processing multimedia data.

The course is designed for students with varied backgrounds, including those with limited experience in data science or programming. Through practical projects and interactive examples, students will develop a strong foundation in multimedia data analysis. By the end of the course, they will be prepared to harness the power of data mining in multimedia applications, ranging from digital content creation to media archiving, interactive systems, and beyond.
