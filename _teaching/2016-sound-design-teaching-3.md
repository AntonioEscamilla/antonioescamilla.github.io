The course addresses theoretical concepts of sound design and implements common workflows in the creation of sound content as an essential part of content development for digital formats / media. Walter Murch, responsible for the term “sound design”, proposes the following reflection that helps to dimension the relationship between design, technical production and the spectator.

"The metaphorical use of sound is one of the most fruitful, flexible, and economical means: by carefully choosing what to remove, and then adding sounds that at first listen seem a bit strange with the accompanying image, the filmmaker can open a perceptual void in which the mind of the audience will inevitably have to rush into. As a result, the film becomes more 'dimensional'. The more dimensional it is, the more impact it will have on the viewer, the more it appears to speak to each viewer individually, and the more it can the sound becoming a representation of mental states of the main character, encompassing the 'song' that Stephen Spender called the groundwork of poetry: "a rhythm, a dance, a force, a passion that cannot be filled with words."

The course has the purpose of training, the understanding and use of the fundamentals, tools and processes through which it is possible to plan, create, represent and develop a sound concept for a given digital medium.
