Résumé
======
PhD in Network and Information Technologies from the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction, Design, and Multimedia. During my doctoral studies (2019-2023), I was a pre-doctoral researcher in the Department of Computer Science, Multimedia, and Telecommunications at the same university. I am a full-time professor in the School of Engineering at Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana and a faculty member in the Information and Communication Technologies Department. I hold a Master's degree in Sound and Music Technologies from Universitat Pompeu Fabra, as well as undergraduate degrees in Audio Engineering and Electronic Engineering.

My academic activities focus on information sciences, the human experience in using artificial intelligence, and the intersection between design and engineering in creating interactive experiences. My research interests primarily include human-computer interaction, creative coding, digital signal processing, music information retrieval, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and computer vision.
