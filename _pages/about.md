I hold a Ph.D. in Network and Information Technologies from [Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC)](https://uoc.edu), where I conducted research in Human-Computer Interaction, Design & Multimedia. At UOC, I was a pre-doctoral researcher in the Computer Science, Multimedia, and Telecommunications Department. I am a Full-time Professor and faculty member in the Information and Communication Technologies Department at [Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana (UPB)](https://upb.edu.co). I hold an MS in Sound and Music Technologies from [Universitat Pompeu Fabra(UPF)](https://www.upf.edu/en/), a BS in Audio Engineer, and a BS in Electrical Engineer. My academic activities focus on information sciences, the human experience in the use of artificial intelligence, and the intersection between design and engineering in creating interactive experiences. My research interests primarily include human-computer interaction, creative coding, digital signal processing, music information retrieval, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and computer vision.
