I am a pre-doctoral researcher in the Computer Science, Multimedia, and Telecommunications Department at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya ([UOC](https://uoc.edu)). I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Network and Information Technologies working on Human-Computer Interaction, Design & Multimedia. I am an associate professor and faculty member in the Information and Communication Technologies Department at Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana ([UPB](https://upb.edu.co)). I hold an MS in Sound and Music Technologies from Universitat Pompeu Fabra, a BS in Audio Engineer, and a BS in Electrical Engineer. My research interests are mainly, but not limited to, digital signal processing, music information retrieval, machine learning, and human-computer interaction.
